# AR-150 WiFi Pineapple NANO

Converting your AR-150 to a WiFi Pineapple NANO should be an easy process.  However, the web & git is full of broken bin images and botched firmware builders... resulting in a broken or partially-working firmware.  The latest working build available elsewhere is 2.4.2.  Here, we start with version 2.5.4.

Summary:
1. Rootfs 2.6M
2. PineAP(d) working.
3. Squashfs block size 1MB
